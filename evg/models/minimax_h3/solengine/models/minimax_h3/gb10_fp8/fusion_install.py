"""Installing the accelerations onto a built model, and taking them off again.

Sibling of `optimized/fusion_install.py`. Everything here is a patch rather than a structural
change, which is what lets one loaded model serve every configuration in
`candidates/minimax_h3_gb10_*.toml` — and, more importantly, what lets the benchmark interleave
configurations inside a single process. That matters: this machine's clocks drift up to 15%
between processes, while three iterations inside one agree to 0.7%.

The Sol-Attn dispatch is built here rather than imported wholesale because the released kernel
package refuses anything that is not SM90 or SM100, and this is SM121.

    Both were true once. The snapshot this port was written against had no architecture table
    and its dispatcher refused anything that was not SM90 or SM100, so the Triton reference was
    copied out and called directly; that copy also carried a hardcoded 951-row KV sink, because
    the entry point had no way to ask for one.

    Neither is true of the current head. `_backend_for_arch` selects a CuTe backend when the
    capability matches exactly and returns "triton" otherwise, so GB10's (12, 1) reaches the
    Triton path through the public function. And `sink_tokens` / `sink_start` are parameters
    now. Measured on real captured q/k/v across three blocks, the released path with
    `sink_tokens=951` reproduces the fork's output to six decimal places — cos 0.994420,
    0.991519, 0.985544 against dense, identical on both — at the same speed.

    The fork's second policy, handing the prefix's query rows to flash instead of the sparse
    grid, was dropped rather than ported: it costs 7.8% (154.8 ms against 143.6 ms over the
    three blocks) for +0.0005 of cosine. The 56.8-against-61.2 ms that once justified it was a
    comparison against forcing those rows exact *inside* the kernel, which is a third option
