"""MiniMax-H3 acceleration line #3: diffusion step caching, made safe under context parallelism.

Two things have to be supplied before any of diffusers' caches can run on MiniMax-H3, and the
second one is a correctness issue rather than a convenience.

1. Block registration
---------------------
The cache hooks look their host block up in `TransformerBlockRegistry`, and upstream registers no
entry for `MiniMaxH3TransformerBlock`. The registry exposes a public `register`, so the entry is
added at runtime here instead of patching the model source — the same discipline the CP plan
follows. `MiniMaxH3TransformerBlock.forward` returns a bare tensor rather than a tuple, which the
cache hooks already branch on, and its first parameter is `hidden_states`, which is what
`_get_parameter_from_args_kwargs` needs.

2. The skip decision must be collective
---------------------------------------
FirstBlockCache decides whether to skip the remaining blocks from
`(residual - prev_residual).abs().mean() / prev_residual.abs().mean()`, evaluated on whatever
`hidden_states_residual` the hook sees. Under context parallelism that tensor is the rank's **local
shard**, so each rank computes a different ratio and they can land on opposite sides of the
threshold. The ranks that skip stop calling attention while the ranks that continue enter the
Ulysses all-to-all — a collective with missing participants, i.e. a hang, or silent divergence if
it happens not to hang.

`make_decision_collective` replaces that ratio with the global one. Both means divide by the same
element count, so the global ratio is just `sum|residual - prev| / sum|prev|` reduced over ranks —
one all-reduce of two scalars per step. That makes the decision both *identical* across ranks and
*correct*: it is the metric FirstBlockCache intends, measured over the whole sequence rather than
over one shard.

The caches themselves are approximations, unlike lines #1 and #2, so this line owns a quality gate:
every configuration is compared against the lossless CP output produced in the same job, on the
same node, from the same seed.

    the cache outside the CP split: the cache hook reads the caller's full-length `hidden_states`
    (38247) while the inner forward returns the rank's shard (9562), and `output - original` fails
    on the shape. Job 5815878 died exactly there, on all four FirstBlockCache thresholds.

    configuration, the hooks are lifted and re-applied around every toggle. Only the hooks move;
