"""ComfyUI's `pruned_fp8_scaled` key layout, and the reader that resolves it.

Split out of the single-file port to match `optimized/relayout.py` next door. Three things
stand between the released file and `MiniMaxH3Transformer3DModel`, and all three live here:
the rename table, the per-head QKV question, and the SwiGLU half-swap. The rename and the
transforms are lifted from `scripts/convert_minimax_h3_to_diffusers.py`, which is the authority
on the mapping.

One correction against that script is load-bearing. It de-interleaves per-head QKV because the
*raw MiniMax shards* need it; the ComfyUI file has already been converted, so applying it again
scrambles attention. `checks/validate_layout.py` settles it against the released block 0:
contiguous thirds score 0.999649, de-interleaved 0.034. `reorder_interleaved_qkv` is kept
because it is the authority for the raw layout, and is deliberately not called on this file.
The SwiGLU swap *is* needed — 0.9996 against 0.0002.
