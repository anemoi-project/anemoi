"""The rank-8 AdaLN factorisation the pruned checkpoint ships, and the re-point onto it.

Sibling of `optimized/adaln.py`. The released model reaches its modulation through
`t -> time_proj -> time_embedder -> silu -> Linear(2688 -> 96768)`, once per block. The pruned
file deletes `time_embedder` outright, ships a shared `adaln_t_table` of shape `(1025, 8)` and
narrows every AdaLN projection to `Linear(8 -> 96768)`.

That is a rank-8 factorisation of the timestep -> modulation map, and it is exact enough to
treat as free: every AdaLN consumes the *same* `silu(temb)`, and a scalar `t` only traces a
one-dimensional curve through it, so a small shared basis reproduces the whole trajectory.
`checks/validate_adaln.py` measures 1.98e-4 mean relative error against the released BF16
weights — finer than BF16's own spacing.
