"""A custom Ulysses attention path for MiniMax-H3, replacing `dispatch_attention_fn`.

diffusers is the starting point, not the constraint. Its dispatch costs 94 ms/step of layout churn
and collectives around a 341 ms SDPA, and the measurements say exactly where that goes: 42 ms in
`.contiguous()` copies and 52 ms in four collectives, three of which carry q, k and v separately.
SGLang's MiniMax-H3 runtime does the same job differently, and two of its choices are worth taking.

**One collective instead of three.** The checkpoint stores a single fused QKV matrix. diffusers'
conversion splits it into `to_q`/`to_k`/`to_v`, and the dispatch then pays three permuted copies and
three all-to-alls. Keeping it packed means one copy and one collective over the same bytes. Whether
that is faster is not obvious — an earlier probe found three separate collectives already overlap
(0.72 ms against 0.97 ms if they were serial), and packing them with a `torch.cat` was *slower*
because of the concatenation. The difference here is that no concatenation is needed: the tensor is
already one buffer coming out of the projection.

**A flat layout.** SGLang carries `(total, heads, head_dim)` with `cu_seqlens` rather than
`(batch, seq, heads, head_dim)`. At batch 1 the batch dimension is pure ceremony, and it is what
makes the dispatch's permutations five-dimensional. Dropping it makes the pre-collective permute a
single transpose.

What is deliberately *not* taken from SGLang here: its variable-length flash attention. The backend
sweep already measured flash-attn 2.8.3 at 71% slower than SDPA on this hardware (sm_100), so
switching the attention kernel on the strength of someone else's benchmark would be going against
our own measurement. The layout is worth taking; the kernel is not.
